Netflix’s goal is to connect people to the movies they love. To help customers find these movies, they have developed a world-class movie recommendation system: CinematchSM. We are going to to predict whether someone will like a movie based on how much they liked or disliked other movies. Netflix uses these predictions to make personal movie recommendations based on each customer’s unique tastes. And although Cinematch is doing very well, it can always be improved.

Goals:

1. Predict the rating a user would give to a movie they haven’t rated yet.
2. Minimize the difference between predicted and actual assessment (RMSE and MAPE).
