Smart Moon Tech assembles and tests two smartphone models, Moon1 and Moon2. For the next
month, the company wants to decide how many units of each model it will assemble and then test.

No smartphone is in stock since the previous month and as these models will be replaced after this
month, the company doesn’t want to keep any stock for the following month.

They believe that the most they can sell this month is 600 Moon1 units and 1200 Moon2 units.

Each Moon1 model is sold for 300 and each Moon2 model for 450. The component cost for a Moon1
is 150 and for a Moon2 it is 225.

Labor is required for assembly and testing. There are a maximum of 10,000 hours of assembly and
3,000 hours of testing available. Each working hour for assembly costs 11 and each working hour
for testing costs 15. Each Moon1 requires five hours for assembly and one hour for testing. Each
Moon2 requires six hours for assembly and two hours for testing.

Smart Moon Tech wants to know how many units of each model it should produce (build and test)
to maximize its net profit, but it can’t use more man hours than it has available and it doesn’t
want to produce more than it can sell.

We will optimize prices and mix of Smart Moon Tech products.
