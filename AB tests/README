For this project we are going to understand the results of an A/B Test run by an e-commerce
website. Our goal is to help the company understand whether user evaluations (reviews) make a
difference or not for the user to make a purchase on the portal.
The data are fictitious, but represent valid values for this type of work.

In general, we perform these 5 steps to analyze an A/B Test:
1. We set up the experiment.
2. We performed the hypothesis test and recorded the success rate for each group.
3. We create the Plot of the distribution of the difference between the two samples.
4. We calculate the statistical power.
5. We assess how sample sizes affect A/B Testing.
